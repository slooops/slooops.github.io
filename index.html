      <p>
        I’m a front-end engineer and designer based in San Francisco. I
        specialize in building beautiful, reusable UI component systems in
        Angular and React. After dark, I build out a Storybook component
        library, and during the day I work at Cisco, making big dashboards full
        of cool data visualizations.

        This site is hand-coded, hosted via GitHub Pages, and refreshingly free
        of div soup.

        <h2>Storybook Library</h2>
        <p>
          A component library with polished (and some
          in-progress-not-yet-polished), accessible components—built with
          Angular standalone, custom SCSS, and a deep love for typography.

        <h2>Our Hours (WIP)</h2>
        <p>
          A timekeeping app for my mom’s small business. Because saving her from
          paper timesheets was more appealing than buying an HR SaaS product—and
          I wanted to learn AWS Lambda and Next.js. <br />

        <h2>Wordle Clone</h2>
        <p>
          A just-for-fun take on the classic word game, made in 2022 because I,
          too, needed a JavaScript side quest. Still works! Still fun! Still
          five letters!

        <h2>Print Archive</h2>
        <p>
          Thousands of pages of editorial design from my time at St
          Andrews—spreads, covers, and layouts from <em>The Gay Saint</em> and
          <em>Hearing Aid</em>. All lovingly typeset.

        <h2>Design Work</h2>
        <p>
          My pre-engineering life: branding, layouts, typography, and magazine
          design. Includes work for student orgs, clients, and queer community
          groups.

        <h2>Work @ Cisco</h2>
        <p>
          Building Angular dashboards for internal use. It involves predictive
          models, secure Oracle DBs, and confidential financial data—so no, you
          can’t see it. But trust me, it's neat.
